### Login Screen

#### I have implemented authentication using Auth0 using Login/Register Page due to time constraint. One can implemented by different ways using JWT, Firebase Auth, Next Auth, and Custom Auth using MERN. If a user is authenticated and logged in, his/her name(email id) will be displayed on the screen with the log out button.
